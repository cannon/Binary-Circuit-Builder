# Binary-Circuit-Builder
Welcome to Binary Circuit Builder, where you can build your own logic gate circuits. Included are NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and XOR gates, and several other features at your disposal to create any circuit you'd like.
  
  - *Placing Gates:* Click on a gate type from the right hand side to select it. Then, place gates in the world by clicking on the spot the gate should go.
  - *Wiring:* Select wiring from the list on the right. To wire two gates together, click on one gate's node (small grey box), and drag the mouse to the target gate's node. It doesn't matter which order you connect the wires, outputs are always on top of a gate and inputs are always on the bottom of a gate.
  - *Deleting:* Select delete from the list on the right, and click on a gate to delete it and all wires connected to it.
  - *Interacting:* Select interact from the right to enable the ability to change the state of toggle gates.
  

### Bonus Features
- *Light Gates:* Display red while recieving false or no input, and green while recieving true input.
- *Toggle Gates* Can be used in interactive mode to change their output value real-time.
- *Memory Cells:* Can store a value. The first input sets value to false, and the second sets value to true.
- *Speed:* To change the speed, click on speed on the list on the right.
